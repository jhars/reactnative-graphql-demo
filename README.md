### A brief description of the project
An iOS/Android mobile application to play in F@nt@sy L@cr0sse leagues. In it's current state, the main purpose of this repo is to  demonstrate my mobile app development skills. I plan to release this to the Google/Apple app stores in the future, so please excuse the leet '@'s & '0's -- as I am trying to keep the repo as private as possible while sharing it easily/publicly. 

#### Setup/Demo

There is Web App Demo you are welcome explore here: https://laxapp--yo17zt86m5.expo.app/

You are welcome to fork and download this project, however, the setup process would require initializing new user group/pool on AWS Amplify and configuring the environment.

Local Build commands for qall three platforms (web, Android, iOS)

```
$ npm run web

$ npx expo run android

$ npx expo run ios
```

### Server Setup
There is also a [GraphQL Server](https://github.com/jhars/nodejs-graphql-psql-apollo-demo) for this application, built with NodeJS / PostgreSQL / Apollo, that you are welcome to download and run. Follow the instructions in that repo's [README](https://github.com/jhars/nodejs-graphql-psql-apollo-demo) to get it up and running locally and then you can checkout the GraphQL data explorer on localhost:4000.
